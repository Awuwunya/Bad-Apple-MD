this works on real hardware, provided you have a cart that supports up to 25MB ROMs and SSF2 bank switching method
(tested on a MD1, MD2 and MD3, PAL and NTSC)
this will also work on BlastEm, but the ending is too slow
this works on Regen but audio will be out of sync
I am unaware if this works on any other emulator
